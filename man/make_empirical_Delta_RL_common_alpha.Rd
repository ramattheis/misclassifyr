\title{Creates a function for model_to_Delta based on RL structure errors and the empirical distribution of Y1 and Y2 assuming RL errors are independent of Y*}
\usage{
make_empirical_Delta_RL_common_alpha(tab)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{tab A dataframe or a list of dataframes containing tabulated data or a list of tabulated data split by controls. The columns should have names \code{Y1}, \code{Y2}, \code{X}, and \code{n} where \code{n} is a non-negative numeric vector corresponding to the counts of \code{Y1},\code{Y2}, and \code{X}. The rows should be ordered according to \code{order(Y2,Y1,X)}.}
}
\value{
A list including 1. a function or a list of functions that map model parameters \code{psi} to the misclassification matrix \code{Delta}, 2. a vector or list of vectors corresponding to initial values of psi , and 3. a function or list of functions for the log prior of Delta in this model.
